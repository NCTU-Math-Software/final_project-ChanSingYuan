## Problem 10. *(Dice Game)* ##

Peter has 9 fair dices with number {1, 2, 3, 4} and Colin has 6 fair dices with {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
They throw their own dices and calculate the sum of points they get independently.
The event of throwing the dice is independent.
The one with the higher sum wins the game. If they have the same sum, then the game ended in a draw.
What is the probability of Peter win the game? How about the probability of Colin win and draw game?
